# Finding Prime Numbers: a case study in algorithm optimization

## Summary
Here I explore coding a simple script for finding prime numbers using Python. I try my first attempt without any optimization by creating the script off the top of my head. As you will see, that script works but runs very slowly. I then follow some online lessons on how to optimize the script and get much faster results.
